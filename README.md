# OSS Parent

A Maven pom project to store some commonly used configuration, especially that related to deployment to Sonatype's Nexus

Some of the configuration will be inherited by including this project as a parent, some will need to be copied.

Please see the [Project Page](http://genthaler.github.io/oss-parent).

There's also the [Issues](https://github.com/genthaler/oss-parent/issues) page.
